It would be better to tell you readers in the beginning itself that it is not the camera that matters but, it is the thought and imagination of the photographer to click pictures which is important. Along with this, a good lens will help you loads. I’m going to be honest about my camera, I use a Canon 1200D. No, it is no high quality camera but a standard DSLR camera. I do not possess any other camera.

Oh wait! I have not told you anything about myself. I am a lad from the humble abode of Biryani, yes, Hyderabad. Now, I live in Mumbai as I’m doing my bachelors in Design. The design world is challenging and worth pursuing. It can be overwhelming at times, but it has its perks and moments. So, in short, photography and design is my area of interest and combining them is my passion.

Before design, photography was an art discipline for me. But lately, it has become something more. Art asks questions and design solves questions, it is a perfect blend like the Yin and Yang. Photography now, has become a major part of this blend for me.

The above ‘discovery’ I made, is a tale worth telling and spreading, if you’d ask me!

To my readers, I’d say thank you for reading. I will be blogging more about the adventure I go on with my camera. Until then, comment about what you feel or what you want me to write on. Stay tuned!

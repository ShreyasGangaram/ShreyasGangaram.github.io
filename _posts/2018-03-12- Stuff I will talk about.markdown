This blog will host content about my experience with Photography and the journey I take to create experiences with my pictures. It will speak about my feelings while clicking pictures, the highs and lows that I go through while shooting. I will also share my instances with people and their responses when I ask for their permission to click pictures. Moreover, the importance of empathy in photography will be focused on as the success of a shoot in public spaces revolves around it.
